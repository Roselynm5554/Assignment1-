        <h2>Our initiative is to raise awareness about animal rescues.When on the streets animals are prone to harm
           when exposed to things such as pollution, vehicles, people, and eventually can lead to death. Its best to contact
           an animal shelter/rescue to bring the animal to safety and find it a home.
