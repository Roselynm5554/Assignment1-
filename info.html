<p>Animals are an important part of life on Earth. They help keep nature balanced bees pollinate plants, birds 
    spread seeds, and predators keep other animal populations in check. If animals go extinct, it can damage the whole food chain and even affect humans.
     For example, without bees, we wouldnt have many fruits or vegetables. Some animals also provide medicine, clothes, or other resources. But beyond that, 
     animals have a right to live, just like we do. Many species are going extinct because of pollution, climate change, and hunting. 
     If we care now, we can protect them and make sure future generations get to enjoy the beauty and benefits of animals too. </p>
